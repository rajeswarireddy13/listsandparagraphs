            <h1>Paragraphs in HTML</h1>
            <p>Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.</p>

                 <h2>For example:</h2>
                 <p>This is text in paragraph.</p>
                   <p>This is another text in paragraph.</p>
